It is observed that in the month of June, when we could see more tourists, the weather on average remains hot, so it could be favorable for the sale of articles, where surfing is not only practiced. The minimum is a pleasant temperature for walking on the beach.

In the case of the month of December, most of the month there is a high temperature most of the month, so vacations on the island of Oahu are a great choice, the weather favors a stay on the beach, so the income could be even greater than in June.

Finally, if we compare the two months, we can say that December is always a very appropriate month to have higher sales since the weather would greatly favor tourists wanting to spend their days on the beach.
